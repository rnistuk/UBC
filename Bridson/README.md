An adjunct professor in the Imager and SCL labs, UBC Computer Science

## Description
Robert Bridson does some really cool computer animation involving fluid dynamics. I
found his paper [Fast Poisson Disk Sampling in Arbitrary Dimensions](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph07-poissondisk.pdf)
via a youtube search and decided to use it to gain practice reading research
papers.
